# Welcome

Practicals of the master lecture [707711 VU The Cryosphere in the Climate System](https://lfuonline.uibk.ac.at/public/lfuonline_lv.details?sem_id_in=25S&lvnr_id_in=707711&sprache_in=en), taught to students following a [Master in Atmospheric Sciences](https://www.uibk.ac.at/en/programmes/ma-atmospheric-sciences/) curriculum from the Department of Atmospheric and Cryospheric Sciences ([ACINN](https://www.uibk.ac.at/acinn)) at the University of Innsbruck.

## How to use this website

These practicals are written in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) (this website is simply an HTML conversion of the original notebooks done with [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/)). This website is therefore only here for convenience: in practice, you will download the notebooks from here and run them on your laptop or online. Each session usually begins with a short student presentation ("StudiKickoff"), followed by a hands-on activity consisting of a Jupyter notebook that is partly guided ("lesson") and partly composed of questions ("exercise").

## Grading

The course grade will be based on three components: the final exam at the end (50%), homework tasks (10%), and the practical sessions (40%). The practicals are graded as follows:

1. StudiKickoff presentation at the start of a session (15%)
2. Final project at the end of the practical sessions (70%)

A positive evaluation of each of these elements is mandatory to pass the class!

There will be bonus points for pointing me to typos / mistakes / broken links / incomprehensible or difficult passages in the notebooks.

## Organisation of the practicals

The practicals are organized into seven sessions. Except for the first one, each session will begin with a discussion of any questions from the previous session. This is followed by a short [StudiKickoff](#StudiKickoff) presentation to bring everyone up to speed on the current session’s topic. Finally, you'll work on hands-on exercises provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

In the final session, we will focus on the group project. Each small group will analyze glacier model output for a different catchment area. Our main goal is to combine the work from all groups to collaboratively create a new, unified dataset as a class.

## StudiKickoff

Each practical session begins with a short presentation by a group of 2 to 3 students, providing a brief introduction to the day's topic (5–10 minutes in total, with 2–3 slides per student). The specific topics are listed for each session and are indicated by the "StudiKickoff" label in the heading. There, you will find bullet points outlining the key aspects students should cover in their presentation, as well as a list of useful links and references at the end of each page that can be used. Additionally, please make use of the lecture notes available on OLAT as a supporting resource. After the presentation, we will have a 5 to 10-minute discussion before starting the session’s hands-on exercise.
