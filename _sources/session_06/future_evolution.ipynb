    "In this example, we illustrate how to perform a typical projection run, i.e. using GCM data. Here, we’ll use already bias-corrected CMIP6 data from [ISIMIP3b](https://www.isimip.org/gettingstarted/isimip3b-bias-adjustment). OGGM also supports using raw CMIP5 or CMIP6 data ([as explained in this OGGM tutorial](https://tutorials.oggm.org/stable/notebooks/10minutes/run_with_gcm.html)). However, running projections with those directly requires downloading several gigabytes of data.\n",

    "Fortunately, OGGM provides a set of standard projections that use all available climate models combined with the default OGGM workflow. We will explore these pre-run projections in the next session.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we’ll focus on creating our own projection run.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three important steps:\n",
    "- Download the OGGM preprocessed directories that include a pre-calibrated and spun-up glacier model. These contain all the results from the steps we’ve covered in previous sessions.\n",
    "- Download the climate projection data and apply bias correction if you're working with raw CMIP5 or CMIP6 data.\n",
    "- Simulate the glacier’s future evolution from the present day to the end of the century (2020–2100)."
