# StudiKickoff: Running into the future

Each practical session starts with a short presentation by a group of 2 to 3 students, providing a brief introduction to today’s topic (5–10 minutes in total, 2–3 slides per student). At the end of the page, you will find some [useful links and references](#useful-links-and-references) related to today’s topic, but you are not required to cover all of them in your presentation. Additionally, please make use of the lecture notes for this course available on OLAT. After the presentation, we will have a 5 to 10-minute discussion before starting this sessions hands-on exercise.

## Topic of this session

In this session, the student presentation should cover the following points:
- What input variables are required to drive our glacier model? (Hint: Consider the inputs needed for the mass balance model in use.)
- What is a climate scenario, and how is it defined or characterized?
- Which climate scenarios are available? What are the key differences between CMIP5 and CMIP6?
