# StudiKickoff: Representing glaciers in models

Each practical session starts with a short presentation by a group of 2 to 3 students, providing a brief introduction to today’s topic (5–10 minutes in total, 2–3 slides per student). At the end of the page, you will find some [useful links and references](#useful-links-and-references) related to today’s topic, but you are not required to cover all of them in your presentation. Additionally, please make use of the lecture notes for this course available on OLAT. After the presentation, we will have a 5 to 10-minute discussion before starting this sessions hands-on exercise.

## Topic of this session

In this session, the student presentation should cover the following points:
- The different types of glaciers: mountain glaciers, ice fields, and ice caps
- Common approaches to representing glaciers in numerical models3(D, 2D, and flowline models) with their respective pros and cons
- What is the default approach in OGGM?
- What input data is required?
