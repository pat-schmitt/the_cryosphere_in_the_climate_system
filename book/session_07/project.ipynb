    "\n",
    "**Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final project, you should pick two glacierized basins and analyse the projected future of glaciers for different climate scenarios, and compare them to each other. For this you should use tools and knowledge you gained during the practical sessions in the last weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline**\n",
    "\n",
    "Please submit your project via OLAT before **Monday June 17 at 00H** (in the night from Monday to Tuesday).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "You will work in groups of two. If we are an odd number of students, one group can have three participants. *(Tip: I recommend that students who have not followed a programming class to team up with students who have)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each group will submit one (executed) jupyter notebook containing the code, plots, and answers to the questions (text in the markdown format) on OLAT. Please also submit an HTML version of the notebook. **Please ensure that your HTML file is smaller than 10 MB. This helps us provide you with more detailed and readable feedback.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each group member must contribute to the notebook. The notebook should be self-contained and the answers must be well structured. The plots must be as understandable as possible (title, units, x and y axis labels, appropriate colors…). \n",
    "\n",
    "Please be concise in your answer. We expect a few sentences per answer at most - there is no need to write a new text book in this project! Use links and references to the literature or your class slides where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will give one grade per project, according to the following table (total 10 points):\n",
    "- correctness of the code and the plots: content, legends, colors, units, etc. (3 points)\n",
    "- quality of the answers: correctness, preciseness, appropriate use of links and references to literature or external resources (5 points)\n",
    "- contextualise your findings with literature (2 points)"
