# StudiKickoff: Mass balance model

Each practical session starts with a short presentation by a group of 2 to 3 students, providing a brief introduction to today’s topic (5–10 minutes in total, 2–3 slides per student). At the end of the page, you will find some [useful links and references](#useful-links-and-references) related to today’s topic, but you are not required to cover all of them in your presentation. Additionally, please make use of the lecture notes for this course available on OLAT. After the presentation, we will have a 5 to 10-minute discussion before starting this sessions hands-on exercise.

## Topic of this session

In this session, the student presentation should cover the following points:
- Recap: What is the mass balance of a glacier?
- What are the different options for modeling mass balance?
- Which mass balance models are available in OGGM?
- What input and observation data is available at a global scale for mass balance modeling?
